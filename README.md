# Getting Started

To get started with this very simple React development environment just run `npm install` and then you should be able to 
run `node dev-server.js` to get the server up and running. This environment is using Hapi with Webpack in order
to bring you HMR goodiness. 

By navigating to `http://localhost:3000` you should have access to your application.
